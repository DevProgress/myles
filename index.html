          How perfect the American sky out there<br/>
          Innocent perhaps of our goings on<br/>
          Let everyone turn around once one day<br/>
          Let them pull the lever, write your name<br/>
          Awesome the keenness of your focus, Hill<br/>
          Regarding debating, regarding knowing<br/>
          You inspire me to stay still, to act<br/>
          You probably had breakfast this morning<br/>
          Oregon was one of your stops<br/>
          Understanding the northwest is part of your job<br/>
          Remembering everyday a woman chooses to keep running<br/>
          Every day you learn more<br/>
          Meet more people<br/>
          You daily become our president<br/>
          May every inch of this journey<br/>
          And every moment of your female campaign unabashedly<br/>
          Nail it like the girl I met at breakfast at Marfa Burrito. Her name? Victory!

            About the artist:
          </div>
          <div class='bottom-paragraph'>
            Jenny Holzer is a New York-based artist who uses text across a variety of media to question and convey ideas of feminism, hierarchy, oppression, and power. She is internationally recognized for her ability to spark and drive conversation through striking public displays. Her many accolades include the prestigious 1990 Leone D’Oro, the highest prize awarded at the Venice Biennale.

            About the project:
          </div>
          <div class='bottom-paragraph'>
            Holzer’s piece celebrates Hillary Clinton’s decades-long work to advance the rights of women and girls the world. Passages from past speeches are cast across the White House as a testament to Hillary’s work—and the milestone her presidency would represent for gender equality.
