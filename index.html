          How perfect the American sky out there<br/>
          Innocent perhaps of our goings on<br/>
          Let everyone turn around once one day<br/>
          Let them pull the lever, write your name<br/>
          Awesome the keenness of your focus, Hill<br/>
          Regarding debating, regarding knowing<br/>
          You inspire me to stay still, to act<br/>
          You probably had breakfast this morning<br/>
          Oregon was one of your stops<br/>
          Understanding the northwest is part of your job<br/>
          Remembering everyday a woman chooses to keep running<br/>
          Every day you learn more<br/>
          Meet more people<br/>
          You daily become our president<br/>
          May every inch of this journey<br/>
          And every moment of your female campaign unabashedly<br/>
          Nail it like the girl I met at breakfast at Marfa Burrito. Her name? Victory!
